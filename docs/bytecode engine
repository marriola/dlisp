DLisp bytecode engine
===============================================================================


The data stack
===============================================================================

A data stack of Value objects is maintained by the bytecode engine for passing
parameters and returning values from functions. It is defined as:

std.container.slist!Value dataStack;


The dictionary
===============================================================================

Bytecode is stored in the dictionary, a 2 dimensional array of bytecode
instructions. Each function is assigned a number and a table of constants and
has a corresponding entry in the dictionary. It is defined as:

struct BytecodeFunction {
    Value[] constants;
    Instruction[] instructions;
}

BytecodeFunction[int] dictionary;


The program counter
===============================================================================

The bytecode engine maintains a program counter, which is defined as:

struct ProgramCounter {
    uint entry;         // dictionary entry
    uint pc;            // instruction within dictionary entry
}


The call stack
===============================================================================

The bytecode engine also maintains a call stack of ProgramCounter objects.
Before a defined function calls another, it pushes a ProgramCounter object
pointing to the next instruction onto the call stack. It is defined as:

std.container.slist!ProgramCounter callStack;

Calling builtin functions may be treated as an atomic operation and does not
involve the call stack.


Instructions
===============================================================================

Bytecode instructions are also stored internally as a struct, but may be
serialized for permanent storage.

struct Instruction {
    ubyte instruction;
    uint[] arguments;
}


builtin0 n
builtin1 n
builtin m, n
Binds no parameters, a single parameter, or m parameters, popping them off the
stack, and calls builtin function n. The result will be pushed onto the stack.

fun0 n
fun1 n
fun m, n
Binds no parameters, a single parameter, or m parameters, popping them off the
stack, and calls defined function n. The result will be pushed onto the stack.

tailcall0
tailcall1
tailcall m
Binds 0, 1 or m parameters to the current scope, rather than opening a new
scope. Transfer is then controlled to instruction 0 in the current function.

pushnil
pushnil n
Pushes 1 or n NILs onto the stack.

pushconst n
Pushes constant n from the constant table onto the stack.

pushvar n
Loads constant n from the call stack, retrieves its value and pushes it on the
stack. If the constant is not an identifier or it is undefined, an exception
is thrown.

goto pc
Unconditionally jumps to instruction in within the current function

jumpif pc
Pops a Value from the top of the stack. If it is T, control is transferred to
instruction n in the current function.

jumpifnot pc
Pops a Value from the top of the stack. If it is not T, control is transferred
to instruction n in the current function.

return
Retrieves the last ProgramCounter from the call stack and jumps to the
instruction it points to. The token on top of the stack is the return value; if
the stack is empty, an exception is thrown.


Example 1
Factorial
===============================================================================

builtin function IDs (tentative, for example purposes only)

=       0
*       1
1-      2

This function will be entered into the dictionary as defined function 0

1: (defun fact (n)
2:     (if (= n 0)
3:         1
4:         (* n (fact (1- n)))
5:     )
6: )

compiles to:

Constant table = [ 0: IdentifierToken("N"),
                   1: IntegerToken(0),
                   2: IntegerToken(1) ]

0:  pushconst 1     line 2  push IntegerToken(0)
1:  pushvar 0               push the value of N, which an argument was bound to at the time FACT was called
2:  builtin 2, 0            call builtin function = with 2 parameters, which are removed from the stack. the result is pushed onto the stack.
3:  jumpifnot 6
4:  pushconst 2     line 3  push IntegerToken(1)
5:  return                  return
6:  pushvar 0       line 4  push the value of N
7:  builtin1 2              call builtin function 1- with a single parameter.
8:  fun1 0                  call defined function FACT with a single argument. The value of N, which has been incremented and pushed back onto the stack, is bound again to the variable N in a new scope.
9:  pushvar 0               push the value of N
10: builtin 2, 1            call builtin function * with 2 parameters
11: return                  the result of that call is now the last thing on the stack, which is our return value. return.

9:  builtin 2, 1            (* n (1+ n))
10: tailcall1               (fact (* n (1+ n)))



Example 2
Range
===============================================================================

This function will be entered into the dictionary as defined function 0

1   (defun range (start stop)
2       "Returns a list covering the range (start, stop)"
3       (if (< stop start)
4           nil
5           (append
6               (list start)
7               (range (1+ start) stop)
8           )
9       )
10  )

<       0
APPEND  1
LIST    2
1+      3

Constant table = [ 0: IdentifierToken("START"),
                   1: IdentifierToken("STOP") ]

0:  pushvar 1       line 3  push variable START
1:  pushvar 0               push variable STOP
2:  builtin 2, 0            call builtin < with 2 parameters                (< stop start)

7:  pushvar 0               push variable START
8:  builtin1 3              call builtin 1+ with one parameter              (1+ start)
9:  fun 2, 0                call defined function RANGE with 2 parameters   (range (1+ start) stop)
10: pushvar 0       line 6  push variable START
11: builtin1 2              call builtin LIST with one parameters           (list start)
12: builtin 2, 1    line 5  call builtin APPEND with two parameters         (append (list start) (range (1+ start) stop))
